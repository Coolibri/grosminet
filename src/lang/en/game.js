Since you are among the firsts pioneers, you were given a part of the lands on the planet to rule, you are the president of a very far away country ! But your growing cities and economy started to catch the attention of some nasty aliens who try now to push you back/to throw up roadblocks in order to make you leave this part of the galaxy. However you don’t have yet the technology to discourage them. It’s now up to you to at least protect your planet and ensure its sustainability.'
